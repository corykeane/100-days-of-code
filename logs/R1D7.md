# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 7

**Date:** Monday, May 27, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Continued reading the "JavaScript Grammar" book by JavaScript Teacher ([js_tut on Twitter](https://twitter.com/js_tut)). Read through the next 3 chapters and covered statements, primitive types, and type coercion. Experimented with the JS console in Chrome as I read along in the book. Had some interesting takeaways (see below).
- Started reading the Twitter API developer docs. Wanted to start working on a small project, but I'll have to wait until my developer account application is approved. The native functionality of the list feature just allows you to view all tweets from all users in an ungrouped list. My idea would take a Twitter list and displays all latest tweets of each user in that list, and display them grouped by the actual user (in a user panel).
- Built a Vanilla JavaScript "To Do List". Check it out [here on CodePen](https://codepen.io/corykeane/pen/oRMvLX). I will be using the famous "To Do List" app example throughout my #100DaysOfCode challenge as a marker for my improvements, as well as to experiment with how things are done using vanilla vs. different libraries and frameworks.


**Today's Takeaways**
- The `null` value in JavaScript is of type object.
- The `NaN` value in JavaScript is actually of type `number`, which I found funny.
- Twitter API requires application. Any API that I have developed with in the past, for the most part, has not required a formal application/approval process, so this was interesting.
