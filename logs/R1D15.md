# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 15

**Date:** Tuesday, June 4, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Continued work on Food & Beverage ERP tablet app. (React Native, Android)
- Spent some time helping people in the #100DaysOfCode Slack team with various help requests. Looked through some of their code, helped test and provided feedback. (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- Made a small change that changes the labels on some product settings in the Food & Beverage ERP web app. (React)
- Worked on SQL queries for a client to help them visualize certain product data, and ultimately bulk change some of their products. (MariaDB, SQL)

**Today's Takeaways**
- Today, I was thinking about how important it is to keep your employees happy. Not just because it's the right thing to do. Not just because everyone deserves to be happy. But, when it comes to employee retention in the tech/programming/coding industry, it is so important. Having a developer on the team who knows a platform (or knows the parts of a platform they work with) inside and out is tremendously valuable. Things can get done much quicker. It doesn't matter how well you document your platform, or how great your onboarding process is. Having employees who have been around your technology for long periods of time will make feature development and deployment a speedy, well-oiled machine.
- I didn't get to learn new things about JavaScript today. Instead, most of the work I did was related to my job. Oh well, there's always tomorrow.
