# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 9

**Date:** Wednesday, May 29, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Signed up for [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I have heard a lot about it, but have never actually tried it.
- Did a few of the HTML and CSS freeCodeCamp challenges.
- Mainly focused on JavaScript (ES6) challenges. Learned about `var` vs. the new `let` and `const` variable types. Learned about immutability and scope. Also learned about arrow functions.

**Today's Takeaways**
- Just kind of went with the flow on freeCodeCamp. Wasn't feeling very motivated today to try and build on my own projects or ideas. Probably will continue with the Twitter List visualitzaion idea tomorrow. Still need to figure out the API authentication and authorization issues I faced yesterday.
