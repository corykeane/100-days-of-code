# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 29

**Date:** Tuesday, June 18, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Reminder: It is not in my day-to-day roles and responsibilities to code. That's why this stuff counts!
- I worked on a fix for my company's payment processing feature. Our payments partner released a new API route that moves away from a bad practice of hanging HTTP requests, and towards polling/queuing. This old method was causing random (and increased) timeouts on the payment partner's end. The new solution seems to work better. (PHP, Laravel)
- Worked on my company's WordPress integration for E-Commerce store hosting. Had to do some simple changes to UI messages. Also looked into some slowness issues related to caching queries against the WordPress database. (WordPress, WooCommerce, PHP)
- Wrote SQL queries. Misc requests from operations and finance departments of a client. (MariaDB, SQL)
