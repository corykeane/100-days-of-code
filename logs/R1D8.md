# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 8

**Date:** Tuesday, May 28, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Spent time writing SQL queries for a client in the Food & Beverage wholesale industry. Gathered product and image file data.
- Continued working on React Native app for Food & Beverage ERP platform.
- Got approved for Twitter API access today. Started working with the Twitter API. Started building basic Vanilla JavaScript scripts to interact with the API. Having trouble with authentication. Will continue tomorrow.

**Today's Takeaways**
- The value of having a business-oriented person who knows SQL is priceless. A core reason for an app or platform is to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing and manipulating data. Having somebody who knows both the business logic, as well as how to tap into this data (e.g. using SQL / without limits of a UI or app) is so valuable. If you are not very tech-savvy, but are looking to become somewhat tech-savvy, you may want to start with MySQL or something :)
