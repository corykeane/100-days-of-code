# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 6

**Date:** Sunday, May 26, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Downloaded the "JavaScript Grammar" book by JavaScript Teacher ([js_tut on Twitter](https://twitter.com/js_tut)). Read through the first 2 chapters. Learned some new stuff about Chrome's JS console, as well as JS entry points.
- Created a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) account. I have definitely heard of, and used CodePen as a reference before.. However, I never created my own account or used it to contribute my own content. Furthermore, it is a helpful tool to quickly code and experiment with HTML, CSS, and JS. It also supports using many libraries and frameworks.
- I wanted to do some Codewars exercises today to help add up to my hour of coding. However, Codewars I was affected by [some downtime](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rd8fbkbiytzt1w2/Screenshot%202019-05-26%2020.53.55.png?dl=0). Oh well, maybe tomorrow!
- I continued running through the official React Native tutorial. Learned about [React state](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state) today.

**Today's Takeaways**
- "SCSS" and "Sass" are not the same thing. I thought they were the same, and that the only difference was the file extension. Here is an [article](http://thesassway.com/editorial/sass-vs-scss-which-syntax-is-better) that explains it well.
