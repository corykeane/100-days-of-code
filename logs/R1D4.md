# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 4

**Date:** Friday, May 24, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Did some coding on my company's Food & Beverage ERP platform. Adjusted the `New Payment Component` so that the payment method field has no default selection on load. We found that users were often overlooking the payment method field, and mistakenly creating a payment with the wrong method. This change forces users to explicitly choose a payment method. **(React)**
- Also fixed a bug that I found in our ERP platform that caused the `Make Payment Button` to be visible for an order before the point at which the order should be made payable. **(React)**
- Continued with the React Native official tutorial. Learned about (props)[https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props] today. Built a component that can be reused given different props.

**Today's Takeaways**
- Setting a default selection on a form element could be a good and bad thing; it really depends on the data. We thought that setting the payment method field to be defaulted to the most common payment method would be a good thing, saving time for users. However, it turns out that it was hurtful, and caused many users to overlook the field entirely.
- Wondering if I should continue with React Native, or just focus on plain old React first. Excited to work with state tomorrow, so that I can build more dynamic components.
