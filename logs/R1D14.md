# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 14

**Date:** Monday, June 3, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Worked on a client's WordPress/WooCommerce websites for their food & beverage warehouse company, and their food distribution service company. Updated their careers pages, and employee application flow (which brings their application process completely online). No more manual process with paper forms.
- Debugged an issue with our Food & Beverage ERP platform's WooCommerce integration
- Completed the freeCodeCamp course on Debugging JavaScript

**Today's Takeaways**
- The freeCodeCamp challenge that explains the difference between freeCodeCamp's console and the standard browser consoles was confusing to me. I am sure this is probably extremely confusing to new devs. I don't think this should be included in the curriculum the way it was.
- The Debugging course was pretty good in my opinion. However, I didn't learn anything new. I want to learn more about debugging JavaScript with browser JS consoles, so I'll take note to do more in-depth research on the subject later. I guess I expected them to at least cover breakpoints and stepping through the code with the actual debugger. Also, I think they should have mentioned the handy `console.dir()` function.
- Logging is a great way to debug issues and understand what your code is doing.
