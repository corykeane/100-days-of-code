# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 26

**Date:** Saturday, June 15, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Decided to start writing a basic Blackjack game in HTML and JavaScript. Here is the codepen link: https://codepen.io/corykeane/pen/qzbQro
- Created the basic HTML document. This will pretty much be a text-based game with just a few buttons for player actions (e.g. "Hit" or "Stay").
- Created a generateDeck() function that creates a new deck with one of each playable card. The deck is an array of objects, each card being its own object with properties like "suit" (e.g. "H" for heart) and "value" (e.g. "2").
- Created a Dealer class using ES6 class support
- Created a shuffleCards() function on the Dealer class, which uses a custom function I wrote to shuffle cards, resulting in a random order.


**Today's Takeaways**
- JavaScript has so many built in objects and functions to work with. These are your tools. You can do pretty much anything with them by using them in the right order, and for the right scenarios. There are 10 zillion ways to accomplish the same thing.
- I spent about 1.5 hours on this. I refuse to use any non-native libraries. I think this is a good way to get familiar with the core of JavaScript for the web.
