# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 2

**Date:** Wednesday, May 22, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Some PHP and JavaScript Codewars code kata exercises
- Continued going through the official React Native "Getting Started" tutorial. Focusing on [ES2015/ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/)
- Wrote the infamous "Hello World" app in React Native

**Today's Takeaways**
- So far, I haven't written my own custom tests for any code kata exercises. I should do some research on writing effective tests, as well as unit testing in general.
- It's funny, but also very educational, to see the different solutions submitted by other Codewars users for any given code kata exercise. I love looking at the one-liner solutions. It sparks the questions of "Should I write my code to be easily-understandable? Should I write it so it takes up less lines of code? Or should I write it to be most optimal?".
- I feel like Codewars should implement some better gamification tactics. It feels satisfying knowing that I am improving my coding skills, but it could be so much more satisfying. For example, when I submit my code kata exercise results, I should easily understand how many points I have earned. Maybe take some notes from [Fortnite on Casino graphics](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/fortnite-amasses-125-million-players,37301.html) :)? This is just my opinion of course.
- It kind of makes me anxious to think about how each programming language has its own unique subset of tools (e.g. its functions). For example, I may know how to achieve a task very easily in PHP, but, because I don't know JavaScript's built-in functions as well, I will have to spend X amount of time researching online to accomplish the same thing. However, thanks to Google's amazing search algorithms, it's usually as simple as searching something like this: "explode() equivalent in JavaScript".
- I wish JavaScript had a "foreach()" function. **Oh wait..** I just looked it up on Google and it [kind of does (TIL)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach). Looking deep into the back of my mind, I already knew this though. As a PHP-first programmer, I thought this functionality didn't exist because I was trying to use it like this: "foreach (this as that) { }"
- Does JavaScript have a `.=` operator? It's hard to search these types of things on Google because of special characters. Any ideas?
- I am finding that I try and solve some of the code kata exercises in a quicker fashion, rather than a code optimal fashion. I should get out of this train of thought.
- Today I learned about [Expo](https://expo.io/) - This is awesome for practicing React and React Native development. Expo's "Snack" tool makes it so you don't need to go through the whole process of setting up your local environment (which can be pretty tedious, especially in mobile development).
- JSX is a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript. The render() function is required in a React Native component, which returns some JSX to be rendered.
