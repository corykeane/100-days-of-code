# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 10

**Date:** Thursday, May 30, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Started looking into [AdonisJs](https://adonisjs.com/), a Node.js framework.
- Installed a test app instance of AdonisJs and experimented with it while I went through the [AdonisJs docs](https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/installation).
- Created a new AdonisJs app skeleton for my Twitter List project/idea. I think I am going to use this framework to build out this project. We shall see..
- I found this NPM package for streamlining the integration of the Twitter API: ["twitter" NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter).
- Created an [Ace Command](https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/ace) to authenticate and start experimenting with the "twitter" NPM package. Built a command that grabs all the lists of an authenticated user.

**Today's Takeaways**
- Using code libraries and frameworks really helps you, as the solutions architect, focus on the business logic and the things that make your app different from all the others.
- Twitter's rate limits are pretty low compared to the API's I am used to consuming. I'll have to use caching to achieve what I want in this project.
- I really like AdonisJs because it is similar to Laravel. I am most familiar with Laravel when it comes to MVC frameworks, so this is great. Also, I am probably going to build a single app to host both the frontend and backend functionalities, which is another plus with Adonis.
