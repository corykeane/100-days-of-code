# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 17

**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Continued `freeCodeCamp` JavaScript courses. I got just about halfway through the `Basic JavaScript` course. I figured it would be a good idea to just do all the JavaScript courses so I can get the freeCodeCamp certificate of completion for the JavaScript curriculum. Also, I was sure there would be things I would learn that I didn't already know. Not to mention, it's good practice no matter what.
- Did a few `CodeWars` code kata exercises in JavaScript. I was having some trouble completing some of these when I first signed up for CodeWars (about 2 weeks ago). This time, it was noticeably easier, given the practice I have been putting in on learning JavaScript. However, it's not easy enough!

**Today's Takeaways**
- Helps explain what immutable vs. mutable means: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jb4tn1x4zxgxu3u/Screenshot%202019-06-06%2020.26.00.png?dl=0, and https://www.dropbox.com/s/wgf4buyutzz3toj/Screenshot%202019-06-06%2020.33.49.png?dl=0
- I didn't know that not using the var keyword to assign a new variable puts it in the global scope - https://www.dropbox.com/s/jeeldpfeukogike/Screenshot%202019-06-06%2020.42.21.png?dl=0
- In PHP it's `.=` to concat strings (separate from `+=`, which is just for numbers). In JavaScript it's `+=` for both cases.
