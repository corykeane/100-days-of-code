# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 3

**Date:** Thursday, May 23, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- More PHP and JavaScript Codewars code kata exercises
- Did some coding on my company's Food & Beverage ERP platform. Made sure UX was consistent for the "order approval" feature.

**Today's Takeaways**
- Surpassed the 50 point marker on Codewars and can now [vote on kata exercises](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gir5l1foet324u1/Screenshot%202019-05-23%2021.06.58.png?dl=0) that are in beta. Can also [mark comments as having spoiler code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vglaatx02q2rlqi/Screenshot%202019-05-23%2021.16.07.png?dl=0).
- Learned about PHP 7's [return type declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.returning-values.php#functions.returning-values.type-declaration)
- Though I spent the minimum of an hour of coding today, I don't feel I accomplished that much. Still happy to keep with the consistency though..
