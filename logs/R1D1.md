# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 1

**Date:** Tuesday, May 21, 2019

- I completed a "small win" for my company's Food & Beverage ERP web app (stack: React & PHP) that adjusted how the Packing Slip functionality works.
- I forked the official [100-days-of-code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) GitHub repo and set it up based on my version of the challenge.
- I signed up for [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) and did a few code kata exercises in PHP and JavaScript. This seems like a great tool for consistent practice, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn or improve in coding.
- I learned that there is a programming language called "Brainfuck". Here is the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) on it. Pretty funny.
- I contributed to the README of my company's Food & Beverage ERP mobile app (stack: React Native & PHP).
- I started going through the official React Native "Learn The Basics" tutorials [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial).
