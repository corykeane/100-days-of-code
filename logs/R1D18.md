# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 18

**Date:** Friday, June 7, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Continued the "Basic JavaScript" course on freeCodeCamp. I've completed 79 out of 107 challenges. I should definitely finish the remaining 28 challenges tomorrow.. I think.

**Today's Takeaways**
- I never use switch statements in real-world code. I wonder if that's because I'm not doing things properly... or if they really aren't that useful.
