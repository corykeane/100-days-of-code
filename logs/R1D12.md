# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 12

**Date:** Saturday, June 1, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Continued working on freeCodeCamp challenges.
- Focused on learning more about JavaScript ES6 functionality. Learned about template literals, object literal declarations, declarative functions (awesome), class syntax + getters and setters.

**Today's Takeaways**
- I am seeing some issues with freeCodeCamp's console and code testing. For some of the challenges, the tests only check for some very basic things. I think this can lead to new coders being confused. I will look into how I can help freeCodeCamp later. Don't get me wrong.. It's a wonderful organization that stands for something great: teaching everyone how to code, for FREE. So their resources are, of course, limited.
