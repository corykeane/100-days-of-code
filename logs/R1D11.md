# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 11

**Date:** Friday, May 31, 2019


**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Continued working on freeCodeCamp challenges.
- Focused on learning more about JavaScript ES6 functionality. Learned more about arrow functions. Learned about the rest operator and spread operator. Learned about destructuring assignment.

**Today's Takeaways**
- ES6 definitely has a lot of handy functionality that saves lines of code. These shortcuts can be pretty confusing at first, but make for some clean code. It's a bit hard to think of all the use cases of these features, but I am sure they will come in handy. I can think of lots of cases where these are used in my company's ERP app that's written in React.
- I'm a bit confused about why some of freeCodeCamp's challenges use anonymous functions and redeclare a function. I'll need to look into this.
