# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1, Day 5

**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Worked with [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) to experiment with web animations using SVG. Check out this basic animation [I built here](http://www.corykeane.com/exercises/r1d5/index.html).
- Tried to accomplish what *I thought* was a small frontend task for the Inventry ERP web app. Basically, in the `Product Search Component`, we want to make the "Unit Of Measurement" data point bold in font weight. It turns out the product label (which combines multiple data points, including the U/M) is a string that is built on and returned from the backend. This means we either need to make the frontend build out this product label instead (e.g. using some helper function), -or-, we need to write an ugly function that first strips the U/M from that existing product label, and then re-append the U/M in bold. I ended up writing some ugly code that tried to accomplish the latter, but I don't want to push that code to production. Instead, I'll have one of our React experts accomplish this in a more best-practice-manner, and I will learn from their proper coding techniques. :)


**Today's Takeaways**
- A major benefit of good code libraries: They handle vendor-specific nuances for you (e.g. browser CSS prefixes)
- When you export a PNG to SVG using PhotoShop, there is some weirdness with how Chrome handles it. You sometimes need to change the `xlink:href` attribute: [see this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10737166/chrome-not-rendering-svg-referenced-via-img-tag).
- Do you ever build a solution to a problem, but aren't happy with the end-result's code? You may feel there is a much better way to handle it, and, though you have fixed the problem, you are still not satisfied.
