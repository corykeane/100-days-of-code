**Today's Work (High-Level)**
- Tried to accomplish what *I thought* was a small frontend task for the [Inventry ERP](../terms/inventry-erp) web app. Basically, in the `Product Search Component`, we want to make the "Unit Of Measurement" data point bold in font weight. It turns out the product label (which combines multiple data points, including the U/M) is a string that is built on and returned from the backend. This means we either need to make the frontend build out this product label instead (e.g. using some helper function), -or-, we need to write an ugly function that first strips the U/M from that existing product label, and then re-append the U/M in bold. I ended up writing some ugly code that tried to accomplish the latter, but I don't want to push that code to production. Instead, I'll have one of our React experts accomplish this in a more best-practice-manner, and I will learn from their proper coding techniques. :)
- Worked with GreenSock to experiment with SVG animations. https://greensock.com/forums/topic/17558-why-does-left-not-work-in-codepen/ Tutorial video should mention this. http://www.corykeane.com/exercises/r1d5/index.html
