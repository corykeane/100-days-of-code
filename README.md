# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## The Challenge
If you've never heard of this challenge, then please see the original README file [here](ORIGINAL_README.md).

## Why I Committed
I decided to commit to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge because I feel that I am getting a bit rusty with writing code. I've been coding for just over 10 years at this point, but, in recent years, have taken more of a management position in tech. Because of this, I have been focused moreso on project scoping, project management, high-level strategy / architecture. I figured that committing to this challenge would be a great way to sharpen up my skillset again, and help with discipline. Every time I code, I feel that I am stimulating my brain by solving new puzzles.

## Rules I Will Follow
Because every person is in their own unique situation (and seeing as the main goal is to simply code every day), I decided to sculpt the rules I will follow around my unique situation. You can view the rules I will follow here: [My Rules](rules.md).

## Progress Log
You can view my progress log [here](logs).
