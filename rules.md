# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
May 21st, 2019

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=tyah)
2. If I code at work, I will count that as time toward my #100DaysOfCode challenge because I am in a position of management rather than that of daily coding (and *writing* code is not part of my typical roles and responsibilities).
3. I will push updates to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress. You can view my progress log [here](logs).
